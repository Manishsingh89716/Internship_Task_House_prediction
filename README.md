# Internship_Task_House_prediction

Task1:- House Price Prediction using linear regression

In this project I've created a linear regression model which helps real estate people to estimate the house prices based on different features.
To make a well prediction, basically I've split the data into 60% of training set and 40% of testing set.
There is multiple linear regression such as simple linear regression and multivariable regression. 
Primarily I've used simple linear regression to predict the price of the house easily. 

Tools Used:- Python, Machine Learning, Data Science, Jupyter Notebook.
